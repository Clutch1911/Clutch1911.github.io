    <div id="Bio">
      <p>
        I'm a Colorado native hailing from snowy <span class="purple">Boulder, CO</span>. I am a student, a musician, an actor, a fencer, an artist, a developer, and a thinker.
        This webpage presents the details of myself, my work, and my interests. Contact me if you want to talk! Thanks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I am a <span class="blue">Computer Science</span> major at the University of Colorado Boulder. I know how to program in C++, Python, Java, HTML/CSS.
        I have some drafting experience in AutoCAD from my summer internship with Schendt Engineering. I use Unity 5 and GameMaker Studio to develop games,
        and I am learning to develop moblie apps with React Native.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have attended two <span class="darkblue">hackathons</span>. The first was the Broncos TackleSTEM hackathon in Denver, where I worked with colleagues to create
        Amazon Alexa skills using the CleverBot API and AWS Lambda. Our project won the 'Best Demo' Award.
        I also learned basic machine learning and markov chains with markovify to create simple Obama/Trump bots that will produce randomly generated phrases based on
        data gathered from public speeches. The second was a local hack day for HackCU, where I spent most of my time learning how to use React Native for app development.

      <p>
        My biggest passion is <span class="pink">music</span>. I have been an avid <span class="green">guitarist</span> since age 10, playing everything from Led Zeppelin to Wes Montgomery.
        I play the clarinet as 6th chair in the CU Boulder Concert Band. I also play some tenor sax, bass guitar, and drums.
        Currently, I am training to be a better jazz guitarist and working on my first self-produced album.

      <p>
        <span class="red">Acting</span> is another passion of mine. I love to act in plays and sometimes musicals. In high school, I performed as a supporting role in Neil Simon's
        <span class="ital darkgreen">The Odd Couple</span> and as the lead role of <span class="orange">Pip</span> in Charles Dickens' <span class="ital orange">Great Expectations</span>.
