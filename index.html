        <p>
          I'm a Colorado native hailing from snowy <span class="purple">Boulder, CO</span>. I am a student, a musician, an actor, a fencer, an artist, a developer, and a thinker.
          This webpage presents the details of myself, my work, and my interests. <a  data-scroll href="#contact">Contact</a> me if you want to talk! Thanks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I am a <span class="blue">Computer Science</span> major at the University of Colorado Boulder. I know how to program in C++, Python, Java, HTML/CSS.
          I have some drafting experience in AutoCAD from my summer internship with Schendt Engineering. I also have experience in server testing and shell scripting with
          my recent internship at HPE. I use Unity 5 and GameMaker Studio to develop games, and I am learning to develop moblie apps with React Native.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have attended four <span class="darkblue">hackathons</span>. The first was the Broncos TackleSTEM hackathon in Denver, where my team and I won the 'Best Demo' Award.
          The second was a local hack day for HackCU, where I spent most of my time learning how to use React Native for app development.
          In March, my team and I attended the CalTech hackathon and won 'Best Use of AWS' for our Seedling project.
          Recently, we flew to Philidelphia to participate in the PennState hackathon, one of the largest in the nation.

        </p>

        <p>
          One of my passions is <span class="pink">music</span>. I have been an avid <span class="green">guitarist</span> since age 10, playing everything from Led Zeppelin to Wes Montgomery.
          I also play clarinet, tenor sax, bass guitar, and drums.
          Currently, I am training myself to be a jazz guitarist and working on my first self-produced album.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am also love to <span class="turq">fence</span>! I am part of the CU Fencing Club as an epee fencer, and I fight both competitively and recreationally.
        </P>

        <p>
          <span class="red">Acting</span> is another passion of mine. I love to act in plays and sometimes musicals. In high school, I performed as a supporting role in Neil Simon's
          <span class="ital darkgreen">The Odd Couple</span> and as the lead role of <span class="orange">Pip</span> in Charles Dickens' <span class="ital orange">Great Expectations</span>.
