        <p>
          I'm a Colorado native hailing from snowy <span class="purple">Boulder, CO</span>. I am a student, musician, developer, fencer, artist, actor, and thinker.
          This webpage presents the details of myself, my work, and my interests. <a  data-scroll href="#contact">Contact</a> me if you want to talk! Thanks.
        </p>

        <p>
          Currently, I am a second-year <span class="blue">Computer Science</span> major at the University of Colorado Boulder.
          I can program in C++, Python, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. I have experience in the workforce from previous internships with Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and Schendt Engineering.
          I <span class="red">work</span> at CU's Office of Data Analytics on the <span class="red">Virtual Reality Research</span> team. We are working to develop a collaborative virtual space for students.
          I like to use Unity 5 and GameMaker Studio to learn about game development, and I am learning how to develop web apps using React.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have attended four <span class="darkblue">hackathons</span>. My first was the Broncos TackleSTEM hackathon in Denver, where my team and I won the 'Best Demo' Award.
          In March, my team and I attended the CalTech hackathon and won 'Best Use of AWS' for our Seedling project.
          Recently, we flew to Philidelphia to participate in the nationally-recognized UPenn hackathon.

        </p>

        <p>
          One of my greatest passions is <span class="pink">music</span>. I have been an avid <span class="green">guitarist</span> since age 10, playing everything from Led Zeppelin to Wes Montgomery.
          I also like to play clarinet, bass guitar, piano, and some saxophone. I currently play in the CU Boulder <span class="purple">Jazz</span> ensembles and you can occassionally catch me playing at jam sessions around Boulder!
          Additionally, I sing in CU's own 'One Note Stand' A Capella group.
          When I have some free time, I love to record covers of my favorite songs and work on my first self-produced original album.
        </p>

        <p>
          To keep being physically active, I like to <span class="turq">fence</span> epee in the CU Fencing Club!
        </P>

        <p>
          <span class="red">Acting</span> is another passion of mine. I love to act in plays and sometimes musicals. In high school, I performed as a supporting role in Neil Simon's
          <span class="ital darkgreen">The Odd Couple</span> and as the lead role of <span class="orange">Pip</span> in Charles Dickens' <span class="ital orange">Great Expectations</span>.
          Although I am focusing more on my music in college, I would love to participate in Boulder's Shakespeare Festival one day!
